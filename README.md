# Airport Wiki

This is a simple application built with React Native, Firebase, and an Aviation API. After authenticating, you can search for American airports by their FAA code (e.g. ATL) and find out information such as the location, wind speed, weather, and navigation charts. You can also write one review for the each airport to rate it out of 10, and the average rating for the airport is displayed. Thirdly, you can also favorite airports that you like, and these will be saved under your account.  

## To run the application

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
